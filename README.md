# DeliKart

### Intro:
    DeliKart is a program made by the group efforts of John Graham, Daniel Kim, and
    Peter Quach. It's our second Year Up capstone project and our first time working
    with each other as a group. 
    With this program we can order a sandwich, decide on its ingredients, choose
    whether to include chips and drink to the order, and calculate its total price.
