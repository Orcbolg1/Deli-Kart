# DeliKart

### 1. Description of the Project
    DeliKart is a program made by the group efforts of John Graham, Daniel Kim, and
    Peter Quach. It's our second Year Up capstone project and our first time working
    with each other as a group. 
    With this program we can order a sandwich, decide on its ingredients, choose
    whether to include chips and drink to the order, and calculate its total price.

### 7. Future Work
Features or extensions of this application to work on the future
1. Add a signature menu that allow users to add a premade sandwich onto their order.
2. Add a GUI where a user is given an interface to seamlessly order their order instead of manually typing what they would like to add to their order. 
3. Add more options to the menu, including different types of sandwiches, sides, and beverages.
