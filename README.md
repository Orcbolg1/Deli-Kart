# DeliKart

### Intro:
    DeliKart is a program made by the group efforts of John Graham, Daniel Kim, and
    Peter Quach. It's our second Year Up capstone project and our first time working
    with each other as a group. 
    With this program we can order a sandwich, decide on its ingredients, choose
    whether to include chips and drink to the order, and calculate its total price.

    "As a User, I want to add a home screen for users."

    "As a User, I want to add an order screen for users."

    "As a User, I can choose bread size and bread type for my sandwich"

    "As a User, I want to be able to add toppings to my sandwich"

    "As a User, I want to be able to add a side of chips."

    "As a User, I want to be able to buy a drink to add to my order."

### Future Work

* Would like to add a function to add multiple toppings at once instead of manually typing each one each time.
* More classes, order screen was huge class that ran everything
* GUI
